  p("This graph has a lot of information to digest. We can take a look at
    each year individually and the trend over each year. Six years after
    enrollment, we can see that colleges that have over 75% admission rate
    (not-prestigous) are extremely valuable for the cost. The mean earnings are
    around $18,000, which is great intial value. We can compare this to the
    other end where acceptance rate is around 0%, and we can see that the mean
    earnings are $5,000 which is significantly less. When we take a look at
    the trend of yearly earnings over six, eight, and ten years, we can see
    that earnings increase across the board. The line shifts up nearly $10,000
    for each sdmisson rate. However, one section increases much more than the
    others. Ten years after enrollment, we can see that the earnings for
    prestige, low admission college increased drastically. The earnings
    increased to around $37,000 dollars! This is much higher compared than
    the low prestige, high admission rate which did increase to around
    $25,000 dollars."),

         10 years after enrollment to overtake it.")

    to high college tuition costs, and a higher poverty level. Most colleges
    around the U.S. hold the same tuition, but the amount of money the students
    in a state have changes drastically. Other reasoning could be that more
    students are persuing higher education, which has a much higher cost than
    community colleges and trade schools. This could explain why states like
    New Mexico have lower student debt."),

    the previous map. The State with the lowest average tuition is Wyoming,
    which also had the lowest average graduation debt. Similarly, in the
    New England area, there seems to be a much higher average tuition cost
    than the surrounding states. This is most likely due to the large
    number of high prestige schools with much lower admission rates.
    These schools are able to charge more and without the risk of
    a reduction in applicants."),

    states, despite these states having relatively lower student debt and
    tuition costs. This is most likely due to relatively higher poverty rates
    or that graduates are unable to obtain jobs and pay off their
    student loans.")
